documentation:
  schema: |
    A Transaction is meant to be the broadest, most base definition
    for all commercial transactions involving a buyer and a seller or a sender
    and receiver, whether that's an ecommerce order, a ACH transfer, or a real
    estate sale.
  fields:
    id: |
      Unique identifier for this transaction, required so that transactions can
      be safely de-duplicated. If data does not have a unique identifier, either
      create one, or use a more basic schema like `common.Measurement`.
